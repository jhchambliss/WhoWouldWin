        2. Enter three variables on which you will rank these contestants. \n
        3. Determine whether or not any of the variables is more important than other variables or if they are all equally meaningful. \n
        4. Press submit to go to the ranking screen. \n
        5. Rank each contestant on a scale of 1 to 10 for each variable. (NOTE: Scoring higher means being better, so if having less of something is preferred, score that higher. Example, if having a lower cost is desired, a cheaper price would score higher.) \n
        6. Press submit to find out who/what won based on your input.
