        1. Enter the names of two people or things that you are deciding between or that are in
        competition with one another. \n\n
        2. Enter three variables on which you will rank these contestants. \n\n
        3. Determine whether or not any of the variables is more important than other variables or
        if they are all equally meaningful. \n\n
        4. Press submit to go to the ranking screen. \n\n
        5. Rank each contestant on a scale of 1 to 10 for each variable. (NOTE: Scoring higher means
        being better, so if having less of something is preferred, score that higher. Example, if
        having a lower cost is desired, a cheaper price would score higher.) \n\n
        6. Press submit to find out who/what won based on your input.

        This app was developed because making decisions can be hard. \n\n
        It was initially conceived of as a means of deciding which employee would be better for a
        specific sales opportunity. \n\n
        Technically any two things can compete against each other. What makes a better pet — a rock
        or a taco? Which Golden Girl is really the best? Should you order pizza or ramen for dinner?
        Who knows? Well … now you can.
